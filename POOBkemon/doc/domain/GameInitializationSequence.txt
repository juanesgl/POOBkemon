## Sequence Description

1. The GameController initiates the game creation process by calling startGame().
2. The controller creates sample Pokemon teams and items if not provided.
3. The controller asks for player names and colors through dialog boxes.
4. The controller creates HumanPlayer instances with the provided information.
5. The controller creates a NormalMode instance as the game mode.
6. The controller creates a new Game instance with the game mode and players.
7. During Game initialization:
   - A coin toss determines which player goes first
   - The turn timer is started
8. The controller tells the POOBkemonGUI to show the game screen with the created game.
9. The POOBkemonGUI sets the game in the GameScreen and initializes the battle UI.

This sequence diagram shows the initialization process of a game in the POOBkemon application, from the controller creating the necessary objects to the UI being updated to show the game screen.
